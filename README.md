## CNN-for-Molecular-Properties

This section focuses on the fusion of data science, machine learning with molecules and chemistry.

Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image analysis and pattern recognition with molecular dataset QM9 and toolbox SchNetPack on Google Colab.

Chose atomization energy as the imput and prediction parameter, and 1000 training examples in 2D/3D dataset for validation, successfully reduced the learning rate without improvement of the validation loss. 

Investigated its ‘Final validation MAE’ with 200 epochs on GPU (Tesla T4) and predictions, then repeat with 3D data as descriptors and compared their performance.

### Computation-aided characterization for molecules

Train a forward model with public database from PubChem, NIST, Wiley’s library, etc. Once we input a molecule structure (graph-based representation), it will output the spectra automatically.


### Generative adversarial network (GAN)

Sample generated by simulation tools, which is considered as a generative model for the data as they can be used to generate data of the same complexity and format as the actual experimental data. we can build a simulation modle to generate these data to replace the experiments, which can be used in generative Adversarial network(GAN).

### Representations

What's the way neural networks learn to represent information in physical world?

### Some challenges

There are several open challenges that need to be overcome in order to move to larger systems, longer time scales, higher data efficiency, better generalization and transferability, and eventually more accurate and realistic applications.
